Supervised Learning with Exploratory Data Analysis:
Mchezo Pesa Project

Defining the Question You have been recruited as a football analyst in a company - Mchezopesa Ltd and tasked to accomplish the task below.
A prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training).

# a) Specifying the Question Mchezo pesa is a football analyst company in East Africa. Mchezo-Pesa would like to predict the result of a game based whether the teams playing are in their home country or not and whether the game is friendly or not.

# b) Defining the Metric for Success This project will be successful when: 1)We accurately predict the winning team based on the two factors:

a)Home team or away team

b)The type of tournament

2)The model achieves atleast 80% accuracy

3)Have the lowest RMSE score possible

# c) Understanding the context

The Coca-Cola ranking system was designed by FIFA and named 'SUM'. This ranking method utilises a metric that adds or subtracts points to the previous score instead of finding the average score. The lowest score which may be negative indicates the worst team while the highest score indicated the best team.

# d)Experimental Design

The project was undertaken using the following design Datasets(Fifa-ranking.csv + results.csv)

Merging datasets

Performing EDA

Feature Engineering

Polynomial Regression

Logistic regression

Computing the RMSE

Plotting residual plots

Assess their heteroscedasticity using Barlette's test

Challenging the solution

Conclusion

e) Data Relevance

The relavance of our data will be answered by the following questions.

How accurate is the data at predicting the outcome of the games?

Was the dataset sufficient?

Was the data biased?

Is the data source a reliable source?
